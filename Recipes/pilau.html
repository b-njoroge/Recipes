            <li>2 medium onions.</li>
            <li>6 garlic, peeled.</li>
            <li>2-inches ginger, peeled.</li>
            <li>2 tsp whole cumin seeds.</li>
            <li>1 tsp whole black peppercorns.</li>
            <li>1 ½ tsp whole coriander seeds.</li>
            <li>1 tsp whole cloves.</li>
            <li>2-inches cinnamon quill/ stick.</li>
            <li>3 bay leaves.</li>
            <li>1 ½ salt.</li>
            <li>4 tbsp cooking oil.</li>
            <li>5 cups of water.</li>
            <li>3 cups/ 600 gr basmati rice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Wash and rinse the rice until water runs clear. Then soak the rice in plenty of water. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Peel and chop one of the onions. Heat the oil in a large cooking pan and fry the onion until it turns golden. Do take care and keep stirring so the onion cooks evenly.</li>
                <li>Then add the whole cumin seeds, whole black peppercorns, whole coriander seeds, whole cloves, cinnamon quill, black cardamoms, bay leaves, ginger and garlic. Toss and stir until the spices release a delicious aroma and the onion turns golden brown. </li>
                <li>Stir the lamb pieces in and fry until the meat turns brown.</li>
                <li>Peel and cut the other onion in two. Add it into the meat along with the salt.</li>
                <li>Pour the hot boiling water from the kettle and cook until it reaches boiling point. Then turn the heat down. You will see the meat impurities floating on the water surface. Skim it off and discard as much as you can. Continue cooking the stock until the meat is tender.</li>
                <li>Next, take the meat pieces out and place them into another large cooking pan.</li>
                <li>Then strain the broth into the meat and discard the onion, ginger, garlic and other spices. You now should have around 4.5 cups of meat stock.</li>
                <li>Reheat the stock until it reboils. Then drain the rice and place it in the stock. Give it a good stir and cook at medium-high heat until all the liquid evaporates. You may have to stir it every now and again to ensure the rice doesn’t stick at the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Once all the stock liquid has gone, turn the heat down and cover the pan lid with a tea towel. Put the lid on and let the rice cook at low heat until the steam comes out.</li>
            </ol>
