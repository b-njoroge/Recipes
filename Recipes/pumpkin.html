            <li>Tiny dash of cayenne pepper (optional, if you like spice)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>½ cup full fat coconut milk or heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey</li>
            <li>¼ cup green pumpkin seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and line a baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.</li>
                <li>Slice each pumpkin halve in half to make quarters. Brush or rub 1 tablespoon olive oil over the flesh of the pumpkin and place the quarters, cut sides down, onto the baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Heat the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add onion, garlic and salt to the skillet. Stir to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is translucent, about 8 to 10 minutes. In the meantime, peel the pumpkin skin off the pumpkins and discard the skin.</li>
                <li>Add the pumpkin flesh, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, cayenne pepper (if using), and a few twists of freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li> While the soup is cooking, toast the green pumpkin seeds in a medium skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until fragrant, golden and making little popping noises.</li>
                <li> Once the pumpkin mixture is done cooking, stir in the coconut milk and maple syrup.</li>
                <li> Ladle the soup into individual bowls. Sprinkle green pumpkin seeds over the soup and serve. </li>
            </ol>
